# See-Food

A sample application to display skills I have learned so far in developing responsive sites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
Some examples of responsiveness are the toggle feature that the 'menu' tag displays once clicked, which reveals the hidden navbar. 
Another would be the hover feature that is encoded in each food card where it both blurs and reveals the title of each food along with a brief
'description'.
